## Data Preparation

This implementation assumes that the customermgmt.xml file has already been parsed, and that the path of the table is hard-coded in the CustomerMgmtView.sql file in the base directory.

The implementation also assumes that an external stage has been built and that three custom file formats have been built-- the logic for these resides in the helper directory. 

### Configuration and running

No special considerations
